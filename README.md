This allows you the user:

- Create a list to house a number of tasks
- Update the name of the list
- Delete the list and all contained tasks
- Create a task containing its title, due date and priority
- Update that task with new information
- Delete the task if it's no longer relevant
- Complete the task by clicking on it
